# OpticalProject
Computer vision project meant for the identifying, tracking and calculating of the coordinates of the ends of the optical fiber cables to be connected with one another. 

## How to run the program 
- The latest python program is the 4_points.py program
- This program utilises the default API provided by the IDS camera -> UI-3480ML-M-GL
- Just open this in pycharm environment and ensure that the two items are within the sights of the camera, if not the program may crash 
- If you want the logic for calculating the midpoint based on the cv2.goodFeaturesToTrack() function, please refer to pages 206 to 265
